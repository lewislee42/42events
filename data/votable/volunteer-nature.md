An initiative centered around environmental education, the **Free Tree Society** is seeking **volunteers** to lend a helping hand to ensure the continued survival of the Taman Tugu Nursery.
A typical volunteering session will see the Free Tree Society team leading volunteers through a brief introduction to the Free Tree Society, a guided Jungle Walk, environmental solutions talks, planting workshop, and Nursery Management.
