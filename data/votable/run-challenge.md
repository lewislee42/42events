Participants are tasked to walk, jog, or run to add their mileage to their coalition score.
Participants are encouraged to execute their exercise outdoors to engage with nature and to create of join groups to strengthen peer-to-peer bonds. There will be individual categories such as *Most Kilometres Ran*, *Fastest 5 KM*, and *Longeset Mile per Session*.
Through this activity, we aim to promote a more active lifestyle for the Cadets and provide the opportunity to motivate those who wish to transition to a healthier lifestyle but don't know where to start.
