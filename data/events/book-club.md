This week, Zi Qi is gonna talk about the greatness of "What I talk when I talk about running", in attempt to influence us all to read the **9/10** book.
Wee Hean will, however, try to disrupt the event by slotting in counter-arguments containing excerpts from 金庸群侠传 and the French-English dictionary he owns.
