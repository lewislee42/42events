# "What the Hack?" Challenge
For those who fancy a sprinkle of mischief, your mission, should you choose to accept, is to whip up the quirkiest, wackiest UI/UX design ever.

If you just want to create something fun and wild in a chill and laid-back environment, or if you're stressed out from the 48 hours of continuous hacking, here's how you can take out all your frustrations by torturing the users (most likely the judges).

## Event Description
The Wildcard Hackathon is where 42KL Cadets can **release their inner creativity** (or cruelty) by reaching to the depths of their imagination and churning out the worst possible experience they can think of, in UI/UX form! This event offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to **work together, come up with ideas, and develop something** not for the betterment of society, but the exact opposite!

## Why Participate?
By participating in the Wildcard Hackathon, you will have the chance to:
- Collaborate: Work together in a relaxed pace to share ideas and create your abominations.
- Innovate: Show the judges that there is a whole new world of wonder and mystery that they do not want to go near ever again.
- Experience: Learn what exactly not to do in the wonderful world of UI/UX, in a Hackathon environment.
- Contribute: Probably not.
